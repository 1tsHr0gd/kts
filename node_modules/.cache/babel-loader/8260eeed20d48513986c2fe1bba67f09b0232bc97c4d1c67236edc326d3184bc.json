Long rains begin in April and last through till the\r\n                        end of May. For some it may not be a great time of the year to travel, however, the rainy\r\n                        season turns the vegetation into a beautiful green landscape, which is a magnificent\r\n                        backdrop to photographs. Additionally, visitor numbers are noticeably less, hence safari can\r\n                        be enjoyed with less of the crowds.\r\n                        <br/>\r\n                        <br/>\r\n                        Short rainfall is common in November and lasts for approximately 4 weeks.\r\n                        \r\n                    </CardBody>\r\n                </Collapse>\r\n                <CardHeader className=\"card-collapse border-bottom position-relative\" id=\"headingFour\" role=\"tab\" style={{margin:'10px'}}>\r\n                <h5 className=\"mb-0 panel-title\">\r\n                    \r\n                    <a\r\n                    aria-expanded={collapses.includes(4)}\r\n                    className=\"collapsed stretched-link\"\r\n                    data-parent=\"#accordion\"\r\n                    href=\"#pablo\"\r\n                    id=\"collapseOne\"\r\n                    onClick={e => {\r\n                        e.preventDefault();\r\n                        changeCollapse(4);\r\n                    }}\r\n                    style={{textDecoration:'none'}}\r\n                    >\r\n                    Currency{\" \"}\r\n                    <i className=\"now-ui-icons arrows-1_minimal-down pull-right\" />\r\n                    </a>\r\n                </h5>\r\n                </CardHeader>\r\n                <Collapse isOpen={collapses.includes(4)}>\r\n                <CardBody>\r\n                The monetary unit is <b>Kenyan Shilling.</b>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                All the major credit cards are widely accepted in city hotels, some city restaurants and shops, but\r\n                this may not be the case in the rural areas or whilst on safari.
